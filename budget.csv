training and mentoring early career researchers, and by disseminating 
information on the taxonomy and biogeography of Australia’s biota.

","The decrease in administered programme expenses from 2013-14 to 2015-16 is due 
mainly to the funding profile of the measure announced in the 2011-12 Budget for 
Sustainable Australia - Suburban Jobs. Departmental expenses are impacted by the 
savings measures announced since last budget, which include a temporary increase 
in the efficiency dividend rate.

To achieve these goals, National Partnership Agreements are being implemented:
•	The National Partnership Agreement on the National Quality Agenda for Early Childhood Education and Care—established the National Quality Framework (NQF), which commenced on 1 January 2012 for most long day care, family day care, outside school hours care and preschools. It aims to deliver a high standard of care for children in education and care services and school age care. The framework sets a national benchmark for the quality of education and care services. It includes an assessment and rating system that has been designed to provide clear and accurate information for families on the quality of education and care services to support them in making informed choices about the education and care of their child. A review of the NQF is being conducted in 2014. 
•	The National Partnership Agreement on Universal Access to Early Childhood Education (NP UAECE) — to maintain universal access to early childhood programmes for 600 hours for all children in the year before full-time school, delivered by a degree qualified early childhood teacher who meets the NQF requirements, with a focus on participation by vulnerable and disadvantaged children. The National Partnership supports access to early childhood education programmes. A review of this National Partnership is being conducted in 2014.
•	The National Partnership Agreement on Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Fee Waivers for Child Care Qualifications—supports individuals, including existing child care workers, to gain a vocational education and training qualification in early childhood care. This funding removes the regulated course fees for diplomas and advanced diplomas in children’s services, delivered by a TAFE institute or other government training provider.
•	The National Partnership on the National Occasional Care Programme —the Australian Government will provide funding for the National Partnership on the National Occasional Care Programme to support non-Child Care Benefit approved child care service providers, particularly in rural, regional and remote areas to access the care they need. The reinstated programme, to commence from 1 July 2014, will operate as per previous arrangements, with states and territories asked to contribute 
45 per cent of the total cost.
Early exposure to another language is a key strategy for engaging young children with a foreign language and a stepping stone towards children’s long-term acquisition of another language. Research studies indicate that the best time for a child to learn another language is in the first three to four years of life, with language learning also helping children with the development of more general cognitive skills. 
The Early Learning Languages Australia (ELLA) trial will provide for children at up to 40 services delivering early childhood education programmes, to participate in a one year trial of online foreign language learning in 2015. The objective of the ELLA trial is to ascertain the effectiveness of online language learning programmes targeting children below school age, in a select range of languages, providing young children with early exposure to languages other than English.

To achieve these goals, National Partnership Agreements are being implemented:
•	The National Partnership Agreement on the National Quality Agenda for Early Childhood Education and Care—established the National Quality Framework (NQF), which commenced on 1 January 2012 for most long day care, family day care, outside school hours care and preschools. It aims to deliver a high standard of care for children in education and care services and school age care. The framework sets a national benchmark for the quality of education and care services. It includes an assessment and rating system that has been designed to provide clear and accurate information for families on the quality of education and care services to support them in making informed choices about the education and care of their child. A review of the NQF is being conducted in 2014. 
•	The National Partnership Agreement on Universal Access to Early Childhood Education (NP UAECE) — to maintain universal access to early childhood programmes for 600 hours for all children in the year before full-time school, delivered by a degree qualified early childhood teacher who meets the NQF requirements, with a focus on participation by vulnerable and disadvantaged children. The National Partnership supports access to early childhood education programmes. A review of this National Partnership is being conducted in 2014.
•	The National Partnership Agreement on Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Fee Waivers for Child Care Qualifications—supports individuals, including existing child care workers, to gain a vocational education and training qualification in early childhood care. This funding removes the regulated course fees for diplomas and advanced diplomas in children’s services, delivered by a TAFE institute or other government training provider.
•	The National Partnership on the National Occasional Care Programme —the Australian Government will provide funding for the National Partnership on the National Occasional Care Programme to support non-Child Care Benefit approved child care service providers, particularly in rural, regional and remote areas to access the care they need. The reinstated programme, to commence from 1 July 2014, will operate as per previous arrangements, with states and territories asked to contribute 
45 per cent of the total cost.
Early exposure to another language is a key strategy for engaging young children with a foreign language and a stepping stone towards children’s long-term acquisition of another language. Research studies indicate that the best time for a child to learn another language is in the first three to four years of life, with language learning also helping children with the development of more general cognitive skills. 
The Early Learning Languages Australia (ELLA) trial will provide for children at up to 40 services delivering early childhood education programmes, to participate in a one year trial of online foreign language learning in 2015. The objective of the ELLA trial is to ascertain the effectiveness of online language learning programmes targeting children below school age, in a select range of languages, providing young children with early exposure to languages other than English. 
Administered items
There are two sub-elements of this administered item:
-	under the NP UAECE, funding for early childhood data development, review and research activities
-	funding for the ELLA trial.

-	providing additional funding to meet the higher cost of regional provision of higher education
-	supporting students to prepare for and successfully complete higher education through funding for enabling courses

This is achieved through the provision of income contingent loans for students undertaking higher education courses and in certain higher level vocational education and training courses.
The components of programme 3.4 contribute to achieving this objective are: 
-	HECS-HELP—provides loans to eligible Commonwealth supported higher education students to pay their student contributions. 
-	FEE-HELP—provides loans to eligible fee-paying higher education students to pay all or part of their tuition fees. 
-	OS-HELP—provides loans to eligible Commonwealth supported higher education students who wish to undertake some of their Australian course of study overseas. 
-	SA-HELP—provides loans to eligible higher education students to pay student services and amenities fees charged by their higher education provider. 
-	VET FEE-HELP—provides loans to eligible students to pay all or part of their tuition fees for Vocational Education and Training (VET) accredited diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma courses.
","It is expected that changes to Higher Education Loan Programme will moderate expenditure growth associated with improving access to loans and students paying a greater share of the cost of their higher education. These include the change to the interest rate that broadly reflects the cost of government borrowings to fund loans, and a new repayment threshold. From 2015–16 expenditure is estimated to increase in line with student fees under the new policies announced in this Budget.",
